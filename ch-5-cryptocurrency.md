## What is Cryptocurrency?

A `cryptocurrency` is a digital currency secured by cryptography, making it almost impossible to double-spend or counterfeit. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and based on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger enforced smart contracts on a network of nodes.

You can purchase Cryptocurrencies from `cryptocurrency` exchanges. Exchanges enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. The skyrocketing value of cryptocurrencies has made them popular as trading instruments. They are also commonly used for cross-border transfers.

When Bitcoin launched in 2009, it didn’t have any competition in the new realm of digital currency. But by 2011, new types of cryptocurrencies began to emerge. Today, there are thousands of different types of cryptocurrencies; While each has its characteristics and functions, their origins can be traced back to bitcoin's influential launch.

### Altcoins

In general, all other cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin are referred to as `altcoins`. This is short for alternative coin. We won't dive too deep into other altcoins but to name a few, some of the most popular altcoins on the market are Ether, XRP, ADA, and SOL. It cannot be said which altcoin is the 'best' since each has different features and focus. Let's take Ethereum for example. It's important to note that users use the name Ethereum when speaking about the broader blockchain network but Ether (ETH) is the proper name when referencing the actual currency itself. Ether value has grown significantly since its launch in 2015 thanks to its smart contract implementation and the growing popularity of digitally scarce art  NFT's. Ether now has a market cap of more than 500 billion dollars, ranking second to bitcoin.

There are various ways to categorize altcoins and some can even be put into multiple categories:

1. **Stablecoins**: A type of cryptocurrency with a value that's attached to another less volatile asset such as fiat currency
2. **Memecoins**: Named after social media puns, they are a type of altcoin whose value comes from community buy-in more than anything else.
3. **Utility Tokens**: A type of cryptocurrency developed to pay for transactions, including fees, to publish art, mint tokens, trade services, and receive certain assets on any particular blockchain.
4. **Governance Tokens**: A type of utility token that purchases certain voting privileges, such as the ability to participate in blockchain-wide polls and decisions that influence blockchain ecosystems.

## Advantages of Cryptocurrency

One of Cryptocurrencies main intent was to transform the financial market.

Cryptocurrencies are the new decentralized paradigm for financial services (If you remember we referred to this as DeFi). In this system, decentralized systems police themselves and do not need trusted intermediaries such as a bank. In doing so, cryptocurrencies eliminate the possibility of a single point of failure, like with large banks.

As we spoke about in Module 1, because they do not require third-party intermediaries, `cryptocurrency` transfers between two parties can be faster for some special money/asset transfers. A good example of this is `flash loans`. `Flash loans` are loans used in decentralized finance which are processed without backing collateral and can be executed within seconds.

Another huge advantage of `cryptocurrency` is being able to generate profits via investment. The `cryptocurrency` market can be very volatile but if invest your coins in a smart way, they can generate wealth long term.

A `remittance` is a payment of money that is transferred to another party. The term is most often used to describe money sent by someone working abroad to their family in another country. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are serving as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across countries. A fiat currency is converted to bitcoin, or another `cryptocurrency`, transferred across borders and then converted back to the destinations fiat currency. This method streamlines the transfer process and makes It cheaper for all parties involved.

## Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency

Although cryptocurrencies come with plenty of advantages they also come with disadvantages as well.

Although many seem to think `cryptocurrency` transactions are anonymous, this is not always the case. If those transactions are made on public blockchains, like bitcoin, for example, they always leave a digital trail on the public ledger. Those transactions can be easily tracked as anyone can look them up.

Their have also been concerns about illegal operations involving cryptocurrency's. You may be familiar with the [Silk Road](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silk-road.asp) or [Ross Ulbricht](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/ross-ulbricht-dark-net-pirate/) i.e. “Dread Pirate Roberts” controversies, but it's incredibly important to understand that this is not indicative of general use.

Although cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized and their wealth distributed between many parties on the blockchain, the reality of it is, that most of their ownership is highly concentrated. A [study conducted by MIT](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29396/w29396.pdf) found that just 11,000 investors held about 45% of bitcoins’ value. That can be directly correlated to the amount of power it takes to mine bitcoin. The expensive energy cost has concentrated mining among large firms. The same MIT study showed that 10% of miners account for 90% of bitcoins mining capacity.

Even though blockchains are meant to be highly secure, that does not mean other `cryptocurrency` repositories such as exchanges and wallets (which we will cover later on) are free from being targeted. These attacks sometimes have resulted in millions worth of `cryptocurrency` being stolen.
