# Chapter 12.1: How This will work

Starting with this chapter, we will begin the practical development portion of this course. Moving forward will begin learning how to utilize the Algorand Python SDK to interact with the Algorand network. This chapter, in particular, will focus on getting our development environment set up and configured, creating Algorand accounts, and sending Algo transfer transactions.

## A Thing to Note Moving Forward

Moving forward for chapters 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, we are going to build out a lot of logic which will all work in tandem. Each chapter will have its own project directory, and each file structure will be architected in a way that allows us to separate each portion of our logic into different modules, which will all be utilized within a `main.py` file.
