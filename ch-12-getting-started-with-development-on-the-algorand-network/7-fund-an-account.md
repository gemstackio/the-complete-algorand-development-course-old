# Fund an Account
## What we are going to do
In order to actually use our accounts. We need to fund them on the testnet. To do this, go to [Algorand Dispenser](https://dispenser.testnet.aws.algodev.network/ "Algorand Dispenser") and put in the address you want to fund.

## How to do it
1. Copy one of your `wallet addresses`
2. Go to [Algorand Dispenser](https://dispenser.testnet.aws.algodev.network/ "Algorand Dispenser")
3. Paste it into the `Algorand Account` field
4. Click on the captcha at the top to verify that we're not robots
5. Click `DISPENSE`

**Note:** It will take a few seconds, but we should see the Transaction ID at the bottom once it goes through.
