## What is a Smart Contract?

A `smart contract` is a self-executing contract on a blockchain network; with the terms of the agreement between a buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code controls the execution. `Smart contracts` allow transactions with complicated business logic to be carried out without the need for a central authority.

American cryptographer and computer scientist Nick Szabo introduced the term "`smart contract`" in his [paper published in 1994](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html), as a graduate student at the University of Washington. He defined them as computerized transaction protocols that execute the terms of a contract. Szabo also invented a virtual currency called ‘Bit Gold’ in 1998, ten or so years before the introduction of bitcoin. There are even rumors out there that Szabo is the identity behind Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of bitcoin, but Szabo has since denied those rumors.

In his paper, Szabo also proposed the execution of a contract for synthetic assets, such as derivatives and bonds. In an excerpt from his paper, Szabo wrote the following, "These new securities are formed by combining securities (such as bonds) and derivatives (options and futures) in a wide variety of ways. Very complex term structures for payments can now be built into standardized contracts and traded with low transaction costs, due to computerized analysis of these complex term structures." A few of Szabo’s predictions authored in his paper came to fruition in ways preceding blockchain technology. For example, options and futures trading is now mostly conducted through massive computer networks, running complex term structures and algorithms.

## How do Smart Contracts Work?

`Smart contracts` are the backend code that allow developers to build a decentralized apps (dApps), as well as tokens. DeFi apps allow cryptocurrency holders to engage in complex financial transactions that include, savings, loans, insurance, etc., without a bank or other financial institution involved and taking a cut of the assets. Some of the most popular `smart contract` powered dApps today include:

1.	**Uniswap**: A decentralized exchange that allows users, via a `smart contract`, to trade certain kinds of crypto without any central authority setting the exchange rates.
2.	**Compound**: A platform that uses `smart contracts` to let investors earn interest and borrowers to instantly get a loan without the need for a bank in the middle. 
3.	**USDC**: A cryptocurrency that is pegged via a `smart contract` to the US dollar, making one USDC worth one U.S. dollar. USDC is part of a newer category of digital money known as stablecoins.

So how would users utilize the `smart contract`-powered dApps listed above? Let’s say you own some bitcoin that you want you to trade for USDC. You can put some bitcoin in Uniswap, which, via its own `smart contract`, can automatically find you the best exchange rate on the market, make the trade for you, and send you your USDC.

You could then put some of that USDC into the Compound application to lend to others and receive an algorithmically determined interest rate, all powered by a `smart contract` on the backend of the application and without the need for a bank.

Currently, Ethereum is the most popular blockchain network for `smart contracts`, but many other cryptocurrency blockchains including EOS, Neo, Solana, and Algorand, have implementations for smart contract logic. A `smart contract` can be created and deployed to a blockchain by almost anyone. Their code is transparent and publicly verifiable, which means that any interested party can see exactly what logic a `smart contract` follows when it receives digital assets.

`Smart contracts` are written in a variety of programming languages including Solidity, Web Assembly, Python and even Rust. On the Ethereum network, each `smart contract's` code is stored on the blockchain. Each node on the network stores a copy of existing `smart contracts`, alongside their states and transaction data.

When a `smart contract` receives funds from a user, its code is executed by all nodes in the network in order to reach a consensus about the outcome. This is what allows `smart contracts` to securely run without any central entity, even when users are making complex financial transactions with unknown parties. To execute a `smart contract` on the Ethereum network, you will generally have to pay a fee called gas. The fee acquired the name because they are fees to fund the blockchain and keep it running.
