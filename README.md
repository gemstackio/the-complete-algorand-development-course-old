# The Complete Algorand Development Course

As a recipient of the Algo grant program [GemStack](https://gemstack.io/) has designed and developed [The Complete Algorand Network Development Course](https://www.gemstack.academy/p/algorand-course).

This self-paced cutting-edge curriculum lowers the bar of entry into the Web 3.0 ecosystem by instructing Web 2.0 Engineers on Web 3.0 development within the Algorand ecosystem.

[The Complete Algorand Network Development Course](https://www.gemstack.academy/p/algorand-course) course will immerse students in learning via recorded lectures that not only explain topics in bite-sized and digestible ways.

Students will start by first learning about the fundamentals of blockchain as a technology finding answers to questions like, "What is a blockchain?", "What is a block?", "What is cryptography?", and "What makes the Algorand Network different than other blockchains?".

Then students will learn how to leverage tools such as PyTeal, the Algorand SDK (JS and Python), AlgoBuilder, AlgoSigner, and React; to develop Algorand Standard Assets (Fungible and Non-Fungible token), Atomic Transfers, dApps, and much more.

The text in this repository is supporting text which is meant to be used in conjunction with the self-paced [Complete Algorand Network Development Course](https://www.gemstack.academy/p/algorand-course) on the GemStack academy website.

You can **register here** for [The Complete Algorand Network Development Course](https://www.gemstack.academy/p/algorand-course)** self-paced course.

Happy Hacking and Welcome to the Algorand Network.
