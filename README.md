# The Complete Algorand Development Course

As a recipient of the Algo grant program [GemStack](https://gemstack.io/) has designed and developed [The Complete Algorand Network Development Course](https://www.gemstack.academy/p/algorand-course).

This self-paced cutting-edge curriculum lowers the bar of entry into the Web 3.0 ecosystem by instructing Web 2.0 Engineers on Web 3.0 development within the Algorand ecosystem.

[The Complete Algorand Network Development Course](https://www.gemstack.academy/p/algorand-course) course will immerse students in learning via recorded lectures that not only explain topics in bite-sized and digestible ways.

Students will start by first learning about the fundamentals of blockchain as a technology finding answers to questions like, "What is a blockchain?", "What is a block?", "What is cryptography?", and "What makes the Algorand Network different than other blockchains?".

Then students will learn how to leverage tools such as PyTeal, the Algorand SDK (JS and Python), AlgoBuilder, AlgoSigner, and React; to develop Algorand Standard Assets (Fungible and Non-Fungible token), Atomic Transfers, dApps, and much more.

The text in this repository is supporting text which is meant to be used in conjunction with the self-paced [Complete Algorand Network Development Course](https://www.gemstack.academy/p/algorand-course) on the GemStack academy website.

You can **register here** for [The Complete Algorand Network Development Course](https://www.gemstack.academy/p/algorand-course)** self-paced course.

Happy Hacking and Welcome to the Algorand Network.

## Course Structure

This course is broken out into 3 Units.

1. [Blockchain & Crypto Basics](#unit-1-blockchain--crypto-basics)
2. [An Introduction to the Algorand Network](#unit-2-algorand-network-introduction)
3. [Practical Development with the Algorand Network](#unit-3-practical-development-with-algorand-network)

## Unit 1: Blockchain & Crypto Basics

Engineers will start by exploring blockchain history while diving into some core principles, methodologies, functions, use cases, and applications that can be designed and developed with blockchain technologies. Then we will look at the basics of cryptocurrencies, transactions, consensus mechanisms, and the common types of blockchain applications.

### Module 1: Blockchain Basics

In this module, engineers will be exploring the history of blockchain, demystifying cryptography to get a thorough understanding, and learning about some of the most common blockchain applications.

* [Chapter 1: History of Blockchain](./ch-1-history-of-blockchain.md)
* [Chapter 2: Tokens](./ch-2-tokens.md)
* [Chapter 3: Consensus](./ch-3-consensus.md)
* [Chapter 4: Common Blockchain Applications](./ch-4-common-blockchain-applications.md)

### Module 2: Crypto Basics

In this module, engineers will be learning about cryptocurrencies, and types of tokens, and explore the intricacies of cryptocurrency wallets.

* [Chapter 5: CryptoCurrencies](./ch-5-cryptocurrency.md)
* [Chapter 6: Crypto Wallets](./ch-6-crypto-wallets.md)

### Module 3: dApps & Smart Contracts

In this module, engineers will be learning about dApps (decentralized applications) and how smart contracts power different dApps and tokens on the blockchain.

* [Chapter 7: dApps](./ch-7-dapps.md)
* [Chapter 8: Smart Contracts](./ch-8-smart-contracts.md)

## Unit 2: Algorand Network Introduction

Engineers will be introduced to the Algorand Network in this unit and how it differs from other blockchains. We will explore the founding principles of the network, who the founder is, the types of fees charged to utilize the network, and the overall performance of the network.

* [Chapter 9: What Makes The Algorand Network Different](./ch-1-what-makes-algorand-different.md)
* [Chapter 10: The Consensus Protocol](./ch-2-consensus-protocol.md)
* [Chapter 11: ASA's and Atomic Transfers](./ch-3-asas-and-atomic-transfers.md)

## Unit 3: Practical Development With Algorand Network

Engineers transition into practical development on the Algorand Network using tools such as the Algorand SDK (Python and JavaScript), PyTeal, Algo Builder, AlgoSigner, React, and much more. These tools will enable engineers to design and develop Algorand Standard Assets such as NFTs, smart contracts, and dApps. This unit will be a hands-on learning experience complete with assignments to reinforce engineers' learning. 

### Module 1: Getting Started
