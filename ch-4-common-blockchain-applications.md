## DeFi

`DeFi` stands for decentralized finance. `DeFi` applications have been an rapidly emerging use case for blockchain technologies. It has helped by bringing in competition that eliminates large fees that institutions charge for using their service, rapid settlements, as well as much more inclusive. Like most things related to crypto, `DeFi` began with the boom of Bitcoin in 2009.

`DeFi` applications give users more control over their assets through their wallets and trading services. It allows for the ability to lend, trade, and borrow anywhere in the world with a connection, no matter where or who someone is. `DeFi` applications accomplish this through a peer-to-peer financial network that utilizes hardware advancements, software, connectivity, and security advancements, i.e., a blockchain.

Peer-to-peer lending, also known as "social lending," lets individuals borrow money from each other without centralized institutions such as banks and credit unions. Solutions also commonly support larger APY percentages as well, boosting returns for individuals. In Argentina, some users have already used `DeFi` to stream their employees' wages, and others have even taken out and paid off loans worth millions.


## GameFi

`GameFi`, also known as play-to-earn, is a blockchain application with that involve tokens granted as rewards for performing game-related tasks. This can range from winning battles, mining resources, or even growing digital crops. This fusion of video games and decentralized finance expands ways that gamers can play.

Although there are various `GameFi` titles, the most successful one to date is Axie Infinity. According to [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/), the Vietnamese Studio video game had $564 million in on-blockchain transactions in December 2021 and January 2022. Axie virtual economy thrives on two tokens, AXS and Smooth Love Potion (SLP). non-fungible tokens and digital certificates of authenticity represent characters and real estate in the game. Players can get paid tokens for winning battles and completing missions. In 2021, the price of ASX went from 54 cents to $94.

With `GameFi `, players can exchange their in-game winnings for actual cash through decentralized exchanges. According to DappRadar, the number of `GameFi` games will grow to more than 500 by the end of 2021, up from 300 from 2020. And in January alone, the top 10 games handled more than $840 million in transaction volume and attracted more than 2 million active cryptocurrency wallets.

Although there is money to be made, users must be aware that these volatile assets can come with steep losses as well. There has been security breaches associated with some of these titles, so it is always wise to do your research beforehand. This new industry has many criticisms that it needs to address, but it presents profound potential for new business models and more consumer friendly products for gamers/developers alike.

## Supply Chain

Major companies have already begun incorporating blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions into their business and operations.

For example, pharmaceutical companies are required under the [U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-supply-chain-integrity/drug-supply-chain-security-act-dscsa), to identify and trace prescription drugs to protect patients from harmful, stolen, and/or counterfeit medications.

Large companies with the capital and technology are implementing blockchain solutions to help enforce those standards by tagging their products with electronic product codes. When units of product go from one place to another, that electronic code is scanned and recorded. Creating an immutable history throughout its product lifecycle, all the way up to the patient. The success of this implementation has led to other companies worldwide starting trials in similar technology.

IBM, for example, has created the IBM Food Trust, partnered with Walmart to use blockchain technology for tracking its fresh produce and other food products.

Walmart was also one of the pioneers to utilize blockchain in their `supply chain` network. They used a solution to help solve the issue of dealing with large amounts of data discrepancies in invoice and payment processing. Specifically for its 70 plus third-party freight carriers. Information discrepancies can add up when you move goods across borders, time zones, a vast number of climates, loads at several locations, fuel accountability, temperature tracking, etc. Because they were moving mostly perishable goods, having the ability to track and verify their produce became invaluable. The network systematically gathers information at every step of the transport and synchronizes visibility for all parties. As a measure of success, over 70% of all invoices were disputed before implementing their blockchain system. Today, less than 1% of the invoices have discrepancies. Even then, those discrepancies are easily tracked and quickly fixed.

The `supply chain` industry gets more complex with various factors contributing from natural disasters, global trade, politics, and a global pandemic. This complexity calls for advanced and updated solutions to  `supply chain` issues. It requires complete end-to-end `supply chain` visibility, not just the details on spending but also critical business concepts like sustainability, authenticity, and ethical procurement. This insight and knowledge helps companies reduce risk, secure their products, improve value, and build trust with their consumers.

## DAO

In this last section, we will cover Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. `DAO` is a group of people who have entered a contract with one another to reach a coordinated goal. Those goals can range from collecting rare NFTs to predicting stock market moves, raising money for a specific cause. So how does a `DAO` differ from a traditional business organization? DAOs are exclusively online; members rarely even know each other in real life. They often do not interact with each other in person. Another difference is they operate with rules enforced by blockchain system/contract.

Although DAOs generally do not have a leader disctinction, every member has a say in decisions made. Some members do have more say than others. When an individual becomes a member of a `DAO`, they buy into the organization in the form of crypto. The more crypto the member owns, the more say they have in the organization (in the form of stake). And while those members might hold more stake than others, DAOs operate under a strict set of rules written in code, and that code lives on the blockchain as a [`smart contract`](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/#smart-contracts). These contracts are essential because they also ensure that the group's collective assets only go towards financing their specific set of goals. If any member breaks those rules, the group's assets can be locked/frozen. We will be covering `smart contracts` later on

Some advocates believe DAOs are the long-awaited replacements for centralized corporations, but this is to be seen. Some critics warn that there are many unknowns about the trend, and that its unregulated nature could cause more harm than good.

## Glossary

* `DAO`: An organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government; in other words, they are member-owned communities without centralized leadership.
* `DeFi`: An emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers like those used by cryptocurrencies. The system removes banks and institutions' control over money, financial products, and services.
* `GameFi`: A concept of building decentralized applications (dApps) that focus on gaming and offer a system where players will be able to earn money.
* `Smart Contracts`: A collection of code and data on a blockchain network. They are typically used to automate an agreement's execution so that all participants can be immediately sure of the outcome without an intermediary's involvement or time loss.
* `Supply Chain`: A network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product to the final buyer.
