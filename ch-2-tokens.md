## What is a Token?

The term `token` in the traditional sense of blockchain refers to a cryptocurrency. Yet, at their essence, `tokens` are digital assets or utilities defined and governed by a project or smart contract that reside on a blockchain network as transactional units.

There are many different use cases for `tokens`. For example, `tokens` can represent a product's loyalty points on a blockchain. `Tokens` can also be created to give users special privileges or access to a product or service. They can even be used to create digital currencies such as BitCoin or Ether.

With the expansion of Blockchain technology, the type of tokens that exist has grown dramatically. You might hear people talk about all kinds of tokens DeFi, Governance, Utility, Rewards, and many more. All of which have an intended use and meaning, but at its core, you can really break tokens into three different categories:

1. Fungible Tokens
2. Non-Fungible Tokens
3. Security Tokens

## What is a Fungible Token?

It is essential to become familiar with the concept of fungibility to better understand fungible and `non-fungible tokens`. In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are interchangeable and are indistinguishable from another part. If something is fungible, it can easily be replaced by something that fulfills an identical function. An example of a fungible unit is the US Dollar or US Penny. All have the same inherent value and can be indistinguishable from each other.

`Fungible tokens` store value and are divisible units. Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin are considered `fungible tokens`. They store value or act as a medium to buy or sell goods. 1 BTC is worth 1 BTC, regardless of where it is issued.

Another critical aspect of fungibility is divisibility. As with cash, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are divisible into smaller fractional amounts. You can receive fractions of a Bitcoin back after purchasing in the same way you get change from cash at the store. The only difference is that cryptocurrencies are digital, so they can be divided into far smaller amounts than cash.

## What is a Non-Fungible Token?

`Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs)` are units of data that represent a unique digital asset stored and verified on the blockchain. They are unique, irreplaceable, and generally indivisible intellectual property assets. The main difference between fungible and `non-fungible tokens` resides in how they are used and the content they store. NFT's can be nearly any unique asset, representing everything from digital art ownership to a house deed. From a technical perspective, `NFTs` are minted through smart contracts that assign ownership and manage the transferability of the `NFTs`.

NFTs can be bought or sold online and represent digital proof of ownership of a given item. Transactions for them  occur in cryptocurrency exchanges or online marketplaces like OpenSea or Nifty Gateway.

The first NFTs were developed on the Ethereum blockchain and were used to identify a product, service, or person uniquely. There’s been a huge misconception surrounding NFTs since their huge market growth in 2020 and 2021 - their perception solely as artwork. The possible applications are near infinite for this type of `token`, from collectible items like artwork and musical creations; to concert tickets and sporting event seats.

NFTs can even be used for storing academic title authorship and digital identities since they’re easily verifiable. `NFTs` have had significant application interest within the gaming industry as well. CryptoKitties appeared on the Ethereum blockchain in early 2017. The game represented one of the first real-world use cases for NFTs in the crypto gaming space, and it has since become one of the most prominent decentralized applications on the Ethereum protocol.

## What is a Security Token?

A `Security token` are tokenized securities. They act as a bridge between the traditional finance sector by allowing for increased control over a given asset.
These types of assets have functionality that can behave similarly to traditional securities. Which is a stake of ownership in a publicly-traded corporation (such as stocks or shares).
Depending on the blockchain network, security tokens can be either `fungible` or `non-fungible tokens`. In short, think of security tokens as a `fungible` or `non-fungible token` that has elevated security functionality such as freezing or clawing back the asset.

Let’s take a look at The Elephant as an example. The Elephant is the first secondary market for pre-initial public offering equity built on a blockchain network. By tokenizing the rights to future shares in startups after their public offering, The Elephant’s marketplace brings a strong source of liquidity to the existing market for assets, which is extremely difficult to navigate. With companies taking longer to go public than they used to nowadays, many can’t touch any of their equity for periods as long as ten years. Blockchain networks provide a market where the equity can be bought and sold transparently, to benefit the rights of holders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike. The goal is to merge the traditional financial and cryptocurrency markets to better both.

There are also some examples of other projects working on similar concepts. Funderbeam has already helped over 100 pre-IPO startups, including blockchains, raise over $5.8 million. Causam Exchange is using also using a similar concept to sell its stock via blockchain, through what it calls BITE (Blockchain Instrument for Transferable Equity). Even Nasdaq has come up with the idea of incorporating blockchain into the listing of public companies, with its recently announced Linq platform able to issue private securities via the blockchain.
