## What are dApps?

`DApps` (`Decentralized Applications`) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network instead of a single computer. There are many `DApps` built on networks such as Ethereum or Solana. These dApps have various uses, including social media, finance, and gaming.

So, what is the difference between a normal application and a decentralized one? Your normal day-to-day application like Twitter or Lyft runs on a computer or server system that is owned and operated by an organization, said organization has full authority over the application and its operation. Letâ€™s take Popcorn Time, Tor, and BitTorrent for example, all three of those applications run on servers that are part of a peer-to-peer network. On that network, multiple participants are consuming, feeding, or seeding content.

It's important to note that Once published, it can be difficult to make changes to a dApp.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of dApps

A lot of the advantages of `dApps` center around their decentralized nature. Users also do not need to submit personal information to use the functions that `dApps` provide. A wallet address is rather used in place of this. `DApps` utilize smart contracts to complete transactions between two parties.

We will go into detail on smart contracts in the next chapter. Another advantage of `dApps` is their notoriety for promoting free speech, which has been a huge topic of conversation on social media platforms, especially on Twitter. A decentralized social media applications are often thought to be more resistant to censorship because no single participant on the blockchain can delete publications or block messages from being posted.

`DApps` are still in their infancy, and as thus many are experimental at the moment, and prone to issues and unknowns. There are some concerns as to whether decentralized applications will be able to scale effectively and efficiently. Another concern for `dApps` right now is the ability of developers to create user-friendly interfaces. Most users of traditional applications managed by centralized institutions have an expectation that applications will be easy to use. Getting users to transition to `decentralized applications` will require developers to create great end-user experiences. On top of performing at a level that competes with already popular traditional applications.
