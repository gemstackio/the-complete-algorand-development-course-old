## What is a Crypto Wallet?

Even though you can’t fold up your cryptocurrency and put it in your wallet, you can hold your keys to access your assets in a crypto wallet. A crypto wallet is a software program or a physical device that allows you to store your crypto assets and enables you to send and receive crypto/assets.

There are  two key pairs inside your wallet, a private key, and a public key. A public key is derived from the private key and serves as the address used to make transactions. The most important and vulnerable part of your wallet is the private key. Think of the private key as the key to the bank, anyone who has access to it can take control of your wallet and all the assets within. So it is paramount to keep your private key say.

It is important to remember that cryptocurrency will always exist on its respective blockchain network and the wallet’s software allows users to interact with the balances held on that specific blockchain. Therefore, the assets aren’t stored “in” the wallet per se. rather The wallet itself stores addresses and allows its owner to move their assets.

## Types of Wallets

Wallets generally fall under two categories:

1.	**Software wallets**
2.	**Hardware wallets**

`Software wallets` are usually desktop, browser, or mobile extensions that make it easy to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency. `Software wallets` sometimes a nicknamed ‘hot wallets’ because the assets are always kept online. `Hardware wallets` serve the same purpose as `software wallets` but are physical devices that can be plugged into a computer. They are often referred to as ‘cold storage’ because their private keys are held offline.

### Software Wallets

`Software wallets` are computer or mobile applications that hold private keys online. They can be used one of two ways, on the web or on in the form of applications that can be installed on a desktop or mobile device. `software wallets` are considered less secure because they are connected to the internet. There are different types of `software wallets`, and can be broken down into types:

1.	**Web-based wallets**: Web-based wallets such as MetaMask, work as a browser extension and can send Ethereum transactions, making it easy for users to interact with decentralized applications and DeFi protocols.
2.	**Desktop Wallets**: Desktop wallets such as the electrum wallet run on a desktop or laptop computer-based application.
3.	**Mobile wallets**: Mobile wallets such as the Blockchain.com wallet, allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency, store it, and sweep the private keys of an existing wallet into the app by scanning a QR code on their smartphones.

`Software wallets` are usually the go-to type of wallets for beginners and a lot of users in general because of their ease of use. Another attractive characteristic of these wallets is the ability for users to make on-the-go transactions from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. `Software wallets` offer a quick setup and registration process which falls in line with their ease of use. This attracts the newcomers to the cryptocurrency world, and users who might not be as technologically advanced as others. `Software wallets` can work with an array of cryptocurrencies which allows users to focus on maintaining one or two wallets.

Although `software wallets` are easy to use and great for on-the-go transactions they are considered the most vulnerable wallets as well. The fact that your keys are stored on the provider’s server will always be a major security concern. If their servers get hacked, all your information is vulnerable. Furthermore, some online `software wallets` operate on exchanges, and bad actors are more likely to target exchanges because of their massive user-base. In 2020, the KuCoin crypto exchange was targeted, and hackers managed to get away with over $281 million worth of cryptocurrency. Not only did they get away with a large sum of cryptocurrency, but the hackers also obtained keys to some of the largest wallets on the exchange. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, was also targeted in 2019 with a large attack.

### Hardware Wallets

A `hardware wallet` is a device that can be utilized to store your cryptocurrency and keys offline. These devices are usually encrypted and act as a USB drive that can be plugged into virtually any computer or laptop with a USB port. The wallet itself is usually secured by a four to eight-digit PIN and some devices has a fail-safe that will erase itself after several failed attempts to log in, preventing possible theft. Furthermore, some devices let you sign off on transactions, adding another layer of security to each transaction you make. Cryptocurrencies will always be enticing for hackers to steal due to their vulnerabilities but following strong security and storage practices will reduce your chances of becoming a victim of an attack.

`Hardware wallets` are widely accepted as the most secure method of storing your cryptocurrency. What’s important to keep in mind when it comes to this type of wallet, is that not all of them are the same. The level of security you get from your `hardware wallet` will depend on the vendor and its distinct features. With that being said, it is worth researching the `hardware wallets` you’re interested in before purchasing.

A few things to look for in the quality of a prospective `hardware wallet` are as follows:

1.	**A recovery phrase**: A recovery phrase is a code that stores all the information needed to recover your wallet in case it is stolen, lost, or damaged.
2.	**An access pin**: An access pin is a numerical PIN that grants users access to their respective wallets.
3.	**Security chip**: Users will want a `hardware wallet` that is built with a high-quality security chip. This chip is responsible for functions such as secure data storage, encryption, and decryption operations.
4.	**Ease of use**: Users will want to consider a `hardware wallet` that caters to their level of technology savviness without compromising security.

`Hardware wallets` also give you direct control over assets without having them keep them on any third-party server. The fact that you’re in direct control while keeping your keys offline is the first step in preventing a hack on cryptocurrency.

Although `Hardware wallets` do not have many downsides, users must still be aware of some of the minor disadvantages when considering them. The first note is that they are expensive.With this being said, users must be aware that quality and security comes at an expense sometimes. It is up to the individual as to where to balance convenience and security. `Hardware wallets` can also be potentially difficult for beginners.

Lastly, but not least, `hardware wallets` do not allow for easy on-the-go transactions like `software wallets` do. As such this type of storage is often better utilized for longer-term holding.
