Blockchain
: A distributed database in which a record of transactions made in a cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.

Blockchain Trilemma
: A concept created by programmer Vitaly Buterin, that addresses challenges programmers face when creating blockchain technology that is scalable, decentralized, and secure, without compromising any of the three.

### C

Consensus
: A fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, such as with cryptocurrencies.

Crypto
: Combining form representing Greek kryptós "hidden" or “secret,” used in the formation of compound words.

Cryptocurrency
: A digital currency in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.
Cryptography` : The study and practice of sending secure, encrypted messages between two or more parties.

### D

DAO
: An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government, in other words they are member-owned communities without centralized leadership.

DApps - Decentralized Applications
: Digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network instead of a single computer.

Decentralized Technology
: The transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network.

DeFi

: the guarantee that a blockchain transaction has been completed and successfully executed on the blockchain and cannot be reversed

Flash Loans
: A form of uncollateralized or unsecured lending, that some decentralized finance networks and protocols make available to investors in an expedient manner.

Fungibility
: The property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable and each of whose parts is indistinguishable from another part.

Fungible Token
: 1. A token or asset that stores value and is easily interchangeable with another cryptocurrency or asset of equal value.
: 2. Assets that represent many of a same type, such as algos.

### G

: An electronic device, usually a computer, laptop, or server, on a blockchain network that stores, spreads, and preserves blockchain data.

Non-fungible Token (NFTs)
: 1. Cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other.
: 2. single unique asset


### P

Participation keys
: are a node specific set of specialized keys, that allow stakeholders to participate in voting and proposing blocks

Proof of Stake
: A decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to use their assets as collateral in order to have the opportunity to validate a block.
