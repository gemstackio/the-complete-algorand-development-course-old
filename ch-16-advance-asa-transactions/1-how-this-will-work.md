# 16.1: How This Will Work

In this chapter we will learn how to develop advance ASA logic that allows us to Freeze, Delete, and Revoke an ASA.


## Learning Objective

By the end of this video student will be informed about the basic Python AlgoSDK project that we will be creating to opt an account into a specific ASA and then have it transferred to their accounts.

## Getting Started
1. Explain that we are going to do all this within on project 
2. Showcase the existing application and what it is able to do.
